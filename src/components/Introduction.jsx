      <p>
        "42clock" is an unconventional app that reimagines the way we perceive time. Inspired by the answer to life, the universe and everything, this project introduces a playful twist to the conventional clock. Instead of adhering to the typical 60 seconds per minute and 24 hours per day, "42clock" turns everything on its head, introducing a world where there are 42 seconds in a minute, 42 minutes in an hour, 42 hours in a day, 42 days in a month, and 42 months in a year.
      </p>
      <h3>Why "42"?</h3>
      <p>
        The choice of 42 as the base unit for time in "42clock" is because to 42 famously represents the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything." In the spirit of imagination, this project embraces the absurdity of redefining time with 42.
